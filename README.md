By using data set (Student Survey), try to extract the meaningful Insights.

<h4>Industry Type</h4> Retail Store

<h4>Data set</h4> Student survey

<h4>Problem Statement</h4> Create a Power BI Report

CREATE: Tabular Visualization, Matrix Visualization, Funnel chart, Pie chart, Scatter plot, Sand dance plot.

Restrict data access for the given users in User mapping table. For ex. Mani deals with Rural area only so she should be able to view the data which belongs to Rural only, not urban and suburban data.

Publish the report on Power BI cloud service and Design the Master Dashboard consisting of Funnel chart and scatter plots. Then create a schedule refresh for six times in every 4 hours for the Dashboard in a day.
